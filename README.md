# License Stuff

You can use some of my code for your own bot i don't mind. But you are not allowed to just rename the bot(Downloading the code and just running it under a new name, or with only a few changes). If you use code from me, your bot has to be easily recognisable as diffrent(e.g. other commands handler diffrent structure etc.)
